# CRT Summary

**What is CRT?**  
Carrot (CRT) is a stablecoin-backed token representing a share of the protocol’s treasury. Every CRT is fully backed by a basket of stablecoins or stable-yield strategies, making CRT inherently low-volatility.

**Why CRT Is Good**  
- **Sustainable Yield**: The treasury deploys its stablecoin assets in yield strategies (like lending), so CRT value appreciates over time.  
- **Simplicity**: CRT is designed to avoid complex liquidation triggers. Since it’s backed by stable assets, there is minimal price volatility.  
- **Protocol Alignment**: CRT is at the core of Greenhouse; staking and borrowing revolve around it, meaning users who hold CRT are aligned with the protocol’s success.
