# Greenhouse Product Summary

Stake tokens earn rewards.

## Revenue Share

We are launching a revenue share program for CRT holders, this will be a beta opt-in feature available to all who wish to participate. CRT will begin to take a 10% performance fee and we will redistribute a portion of the yield back to CRT stakers.

### Staking

Staking allows CRT holders to earn a portion of the protocol's yield in exchange for locking up their CRT tokens with a predetermined lockup period. The initial lockup period will be 3 days and initial performance share will be 50%.

## Line of Credit

The line of credit is a feature that allows CRT holders to borrow stablecoins against their staked CRT. These stablecoins come from the CRT treasury itself.
