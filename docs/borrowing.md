# Introducing Borrowing in Greenhouse

The Greenhouse protocol allows CRT holders to borrow stablecoins using their staked CRT as collateral. Borrowing can serve both the protocol and its users:

## High-Level Lending Model
- **Weekly Adjustable Fixed Rate**: The protocol sets a fixed borrow rate each week based on market conditions and treasury objectives.  
- **Collateral = Staked CRT**: Borrowers keep their CRT locked in staking, but also unlock liquidity by borrowing stablecoins against that staked position.

## Benefits for the Protocol (CRT Treasury)
1. **Interest Income**: Borrowers pay interest to the protocol, boosting treasury returns.  
2. **Ecosystem Expansion**: More ways to use CRT drives adoption and liquidity.  
3. **Direct-to-Consumer Loans**: The protocol can route stablecoin liquidity straight from the treasury to users, capturing more value in-house.

## Benefits for Users
- **Liquidity vs. Selling**: Instead of selling CRT to raise funds, users can borrow, preserving their upside in CRT.  
- **Leveraging Yield**: The borrowed funds can be deployed in other opportunitiesâ€”investments, liquidity provision, or additional CRT purchases.  
- **Capital Efficiency**: Holding stables in a wallet earns zero; borrowing stables from your staked CRT can amplify what you do with that liquidity.
