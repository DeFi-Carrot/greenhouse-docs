# Enabling Staking & Performance Fee Rewards

## What Staking Achieves
1. **Lock In Protocol Alignment**: Stakers hold CRT, which directly backs the treasury.  
2. **Capture Yield**: Stakers earn a share of the performance fees and any other yield from the treasury.

## Why It’s Good for CRT and Stakers
- **Increased Demand**: Staking removes CRT from circulation, reducing free float and strengthening its value.  
- **Shared Growth**: As the treasury accumulates returns, stakers’ positions automatically grow in value.

## Staking Semantics
- **Earning Periods**: Rewards or yield typically accrue continuously, but distribution can happen weekly or monthly.  
- **When You Earn**: As soon as your CRT is staked, you start accruing yield.  
- **When You Don’t**: If you initiate an unstake or move CRT out of the staking pool, you no longer earn until you stake again.

## Performance Fee Sharing
- A portion of the protocol’s performance fees flows back to stakers:
  - This amplifies staking returns.
  - Encourages long-term holding of CRT, fostering protocol stability.
