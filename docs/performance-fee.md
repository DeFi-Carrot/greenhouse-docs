# Taking a Performance Fee to Support the Business

**How it Works**  
- As the treasury grows (via staking yields, protocol fees, etc.), the protocol charges a small performance fee on the returns.  
- This fee goes toward protocol maintenance, development, and long-term sustainability.

**Why a Performance Fee?**  
- **Incentive Alignment**: The protocolâ€™s success benefits from robust operations and ongoing improvements.  
- **Stable Revenue Model**: Performance fees reward the protocol only when yield is generated, aligning with user interests.

**Distribution**  
- A portion of the fees may be redistributed to stakers (i.e., higher CRT yields).  
- Another portion funds further development and protocol reserves.
